# SwiftyJSONAPI
JSONAPI document representation and serializing in Swift.

# Project status
Just begun. Work in progress. Do not use in production. Everything might and probably will change.

# Goal
Making a framework that can represent JSONAPI documents, resources and relationships as native swift objects.
This framework is intended to be a starting point for other frameworks and libraries that supply features such as networking and Core Data bridging.
